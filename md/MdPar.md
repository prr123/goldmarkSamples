## Block Element Test

### Paragraphs with links

A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated
by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a
blank line -- a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered
blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs. 

The implication of the "one or more consecutive lines of text" rule is
that Markdown supports "hard-wrapped" text paragraphs. This differs
significantly from most other text-to-HTML formatters (including Movable
Type's "Convert Line Breaks" option) which translate every line break
character in a paragraph into a `<br />` tag.

When you *do* want to insert a `<br />` break tag using Markdown, you
end a line with two or more spaces, then type return.


### hardcoded ends

A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated  
by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a  
blank line -- a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered  
blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.  

### emphasis

This example demonstrates how to *emphasize* a word in a text. Emphsias can be
further increased by makea a word **bold**.
There are other methods of _emphasizing_ a word in a text. In this example the underscore
character is used to __bolden__ a word.

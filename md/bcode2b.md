Blockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists,
and code blocks:

> ## This is a header.
>
>
> Here's some example code:
>
>     return shell_exec("echo $input | $markdown_script");

Any decent text editor should make email-style quoting easy. For
example, with BBEdit, you can make a selection and choose Increase
Quote Level from the Text menu.
